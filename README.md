# eyetracking

My universe of R packages for dealing with eyetracking data...

* [fillgaze](https://github.com/tjmahr/fillgaze) - [data-cleaning] interpolate missing data
* [polypoly](https://github.com/tjmahr/polypoly) - [modeling] wrangle orthogonal polynomials

I have other packages with useful code, but they are too tailored to specific 
experiments and program outputs. I could generalize them and share them.

* [lookr](https://github.com/tjmahr/lookr)
* [littlelisteners](https://github.com/tjmahr/littlelisteners)
